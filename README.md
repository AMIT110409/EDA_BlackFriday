# EDA_BlackFriday
The EDA process of the Black Friday model typically involves several steps, such as data cleaning, data exploration, data visualization, and statistical analysis. Firstly, data cleaning is done to ensure that the data is accurate and free of errors, such as missing values or duplicates.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Black Friday model involves analyzing the Black Friday sales dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. The Black Friday dataset contains transactional data from a retail store on a single day - Black Friday, which is the day after the US Thanksgiving holiday and is known for its large sales and discounts.

Once the data is cleaned, the next step is to explore the data, by examining the distribution of variables, checking for outliers, and identifying trends or patterns.

Data visualization techniques, such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, can be used to visualize the data and identify any interesting patterns or trends. For example, visualizations can help to identify which products have the highest sales, which demographic groups tend to spend the most money, and which regions generate the most sales.

Statistical analysis techniques, such as correlation analysis and regression analysis, can be used to identify relationships between variables and to build models that can predict future sales. For example, regression analysis can be used to identify the factors that influence sales, such as product price, discount percentage, and customer demographics.

Overall, the EDA process of the Black Friday model can help to identify important trends and patterns within the data, which can be used to improve sales and marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, and increase customer satisfaction.
